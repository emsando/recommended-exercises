# Recommended Exercises
A collection of programming exercises that I recommend for up and coming developers. Repo is JavaScript based.

## Introduction
The language this repo uses is JavaScript, because that's the first programming language I learned and a core language of contemporary full stack development; I won't really go into why here, but the reality is many job training programs (bootcamps, etc) teach JS due to the proliferation of web apps today, and a lot of folks I advise are taking learning paths like this. 

## Summary
I'll try to group things thematically and put corresponding test files; if you'd you can fork this repo and try to make the tests pass. I figure this might be the most useful.
